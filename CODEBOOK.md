Codebook for Cleaning and Getting Data Project 

The codebook describes the processed dataset submitted including the summary of the measurement variables and their units.

The first two variables are:
1.	subjectid: This is a number identifying each subject participating in the study experiment. It ranges from 1 to 30.
2.	activity: This is the activity type undertaken by each of the subjects. It is coded as follows - 1=Walking, 2=Walking_upstairs, 3=Walking downstairs, 4=Sitting, 5=Standing,  and 6=Laying

The other variables are the summarized mean and standard deviation variables measured as time and frequency from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals for the subjects in the test and train groups, as listed below:
